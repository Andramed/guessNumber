# guessNumber
In the "guess the number" game, a player thinks of a number and the other player(s) try 
to guess what it is. The player who thinks of the number can give hints, such as whether 
the number is higher or lower than a certain value, to help the other player(s) guess. The 
game continues until one of the other players correctly guesses the number.
